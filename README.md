This is a project that implements the tile model of the Wave Function Collapse (WFC) algorithm.

## What is Wave Function Collapse?

The Wave Function Collapse algorithm is a concept from quantum physics that describes how a set of valid states can collapse into a single state. In this project, the algorithm is applied to a tile-based system where the edges of the tiles are evaluated to determine which tiles can be placed next to each other. By creating a custom tileset and defining the rules for tile placement, the program can generate unique patterns by randomly selecting among the possible solutions that follow the set rules.
